I have just finished the Responsive Web Design Certification from 
freecodecamp.org and am continuing the Web Development module on
The Odin Project. This is the first project I will be doing using
HTML and CSS. I am tasked with building the Google homepage.

After making my first edit, I should have used flexbox for the
headers and footers. By using the absolute method, the text overlaps
when the window is too narrow.
