I have just finished the Responsive Web Design Certification from 
freecodecamp.org and am continuing the Web Development module on
The Odin Project. This is the first project I will be doing using
HTML and CSS. I am tasked with building the Google homepage.

After making my first edit, I should have used flexbox for the
headers and footers. By using the absolute method, the text overlaps
when the window is too narrow.


After 5 fucking hours of trying to make a goddamn footer i give up. fuck this
im out. done finished. no more odin. fuck this. i hate this . i hate everything
i just wanted to learn something so i can get the FUCK out of my abusive af fathers way and never have to see his goddamn face ever again
i just wanted to learn 
but i cant
because i am a DUMB ASS MOTHER FUCKER
fuck this
